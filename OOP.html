     <h1>ITPC102 - Object-oriented Programming</h1>
	 <p>This course includes discussion on procedural/functional approach to object-oriented programming approach. It also includes the design and implementation, test and debug programs using OOP concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
	 </p>
	 <p style="color:red;">For easier demonstration of examples, this page uses a repl like Trinket. In the Python script on the LEFT, you can type or modify the Python code. If you hit the Run button, your python script (script.py) is executed and the output is shown in the Python Shell on the RIGHT. It also checks whether your code is correct and gives you feedback.

      <h2>Classes and Objects</h2>
	  <p>Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects. To access the variable and the function inside of the newly created object "myobjectx" you would do the following:
	  </p>

	</div>
	
	<div class="title">
  	  <p>You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class. For instance, if we were to define another object with the "MyClass" class and then change the string in the variable above:
	  </p>
